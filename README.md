# Password-generator
It’s important to protect your personal information online, and with this tool you can generate any number of passwords for your online accounts. The passwords will be _random_, so no one will be able to guess them!

* Check how secure is your password?
    Go to www.howsecureismypassword.net ,and find out how long it would take a computer to guess your password.

A computer could try to guess your password by using _`brute force`_ – this means trying out lots of passwords until it guesses the right one.

Remember that your password is harder to guess if it’s:

   * Long
   * Not a word in the dictionary
   * Contains letters, numbers and punctuation
